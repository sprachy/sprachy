Der, die, and das are three ways of saying _the_ in German. Which one you use depends on the _grammatical gender_ of the noun that follows.

::LTable
---
header: Gender / Deutsch / Meaning
content: |
  neuter / **das** Eichh√∂rnchen / **the** squirrel
  masculine / **der** Baum / **the** tree
  feminine / **die** unendliche Leere / **the** infinite void
---
::

These are all in what's called the _nominative case_, the case where we're talking about the subject of a sentence (like a squirrel), unmodified by any verbs.

The gender of a particular noun usually has nothing to do with what that word describes. It's not that trees are particularly manly, or that ominous voids are particularly girly. That's simply the _grammatical_ gender those nouns happen to have, by consensus of German speakers.

Generally, you want to learn the gender together with the word. Rather than remembering that _Baum_ means tree, try to remember _der Baum_! However, the genders are not totally _random_ either. We'll learn some patterns later we can use to predict noun gender for certain groups of words.

Roughly speaking, around 40% of nouns are masculine, 40% are feminine, and 20% are neuter. A very small number of words have more than one gender. They're fancy and rare like shiny Pok√©mon!

::DialogueExample

  squirrel:
    Aber **die** Plurale!
    But **the** plurals!
---
::

For plurals, we always use _die_, regardless of the noun's base gender. For example, _der Baum_ would become _die B√§ume_ when talking about mulitiple trees. Meanwhile, _das_ when used without a noun can also have the meaning of "that" or "it".

::Tip

  Unlike in English, the first letter of every noun in German is **C**apitalized. This is particularly useful when learning the language, as it makes nouns easy to identify.
